## Random how you ask?

No quantum physics or AI is here, just good old plain [`Math.random`](https://github.com/akramsaouri/lqm/blob/master/src/api.js#L8), expect that I paginate **all** your albums, ignore your currenly played ones and all the ones your rejected.

> Works better if installed as a [PWA](https://medium.com/progressivewebapps/how-to-install-a-pwa-to-your-device-68a8d37fadc1)
